Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for TSP
Algorithm Steps:

1) Initialization:

-> Define parameters:

* Number of ants m
* Number of cities n
* Number of iterations max_iter
* Pheromone evaporation rate ρ
* Pheromone influence α
* Distance influence β
*Initial pheromone levels τ_ij for all edges (set small positive values)

->Generate the distance matrix D with distances between cities
->Initialize the pheromone matrix τ with small values

2) Main Loop (for each iteration):

-> For each ant: 

 *Randomly select a starting city
 *Construct a complete tour by choosing the next city based on:
       * Pheromone levels τ_ij
       * Distances D_ij
       * Apply a probability distribution to choose the next city (prefer cities with higher pheromone levels and shorter distances)

-> Evaluate Solutions:

   
*For each ant's tour:
    *Calculate the total length of the tour (distance traveled)
    *If the tour length is shorter than the best found so far, update the best solution

-> Pheromone Update:

     *Evaporation: Reduce the pheromone level on all paths by ρ
     *Deposit Pheromone: After all ants have constructed their tours, add pheromone to the paths taken by each ant, with more pheromone deposited on shorter tours

-> Convergence Check:

      If the best solution has not changed significantly over a number of iterations or the maximum iterations are reached, exit the loop

-> Return the Best Solution:
 
      Output the best tour and its length
