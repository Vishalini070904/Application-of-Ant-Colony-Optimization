Initialize distance matrix D for all cities
Initialize pheromone matrix τ with small values
Initialize best_solution and best_length to infinity

For iteration = 1 to max_iter:
    Initialize solutions for all ants as empty
    
    For ant = 1 to num_ants:
        Randomly choose a starting city for the ant
        For step = 1 to num_cities - 1:
            Choose the next city based on pheromone levels and distance
            Add this city to the ant's tour
            
        Evaluate the tour length for the ant
        If the ant's tour length is better than the best_solution:
            Update best_solution and best_length
    
    Evaporate pheromones on all edges:
        For each edge (i, j):
            τ_ij = (1 - ρ) * τ_ij
    
    For each ant:
        For each edge (i, j) in the ant's tour:
            Deposit pheromone on the edge (i, j) proportional to the tour quality (inverse of tour length)
    
    If convergence criteria are met (best solution does not improve):
        Exit the loop

Return best_solution and best_length
